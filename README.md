This is a first instance of a Schroedinger Solver that makes use of the Numerov algorithm to numerically calculate the solution of the time-indepedent Schroedinger equation in position space, treated as second order differential equation.

The potential is embedded in the code as a class, together with the basis. At the moment the implementation still going on to realize an extremely versatile object oriented code. But one-dimensional worker at the moment is working just fine.

Output are the energy and the resulting wavefunction.

## Numerov Solver

Numerov solver takes in input an energy bracket in which to look for solution. Increasing from the minimum energy, it takes the lowest energy non-trivial solution as the one that respects boundary conditions.

## Requisites

- A C++17-compliant compiler with special math functions support (gcc >= 6.1, clang >= 5.0.0, icc >= 18.0.0, MSVC >= 19.14)
- CMake (>= 3.5)

## How to build

From the CLI navigate into project's directory, then run:

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

You'll find the executable file in `Schroedinger/build/bin/`.
